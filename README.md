JavaScript Superhero API Application

Introduction:

Welcome to my JavaScript Marvel Superhero Application! This project showcases my proficiency with advanced JavaScript tools and features. You will explore my favorite Marvel superheroes and interact with an API to discover more characters. This assessment demonstrates my capability to implement asynchronous JavaScript in a practical and engaging manner.

Objectives:
- Utilize asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
- Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
- Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
- Organize files using modules and imports.

Features:
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Implement asynchronous functions using Promises and async/await.
- Fetch data from an external web API using fetch and/or Axios.

Event Handling:
- Register event listeners to handle user input and API requests.
- Display data dynamically based on user interactions.

User Interface:
- Display cards featuring my six favorite Marvel superheroes.
- Provide an input area for users to enter a number from 1-30 to fetch information about other Marvel characters.
- Display the fetched character's name, skills/powers, allies, villains, and aliases.

Instructions:
I created a single-page web application where users can view my favorite Marvel superheroes and explore more characters through an API. The technical requirements were prioritized to ensure minimum functionality was met first, with additional features added as time allowed.

Steps to Use:
- Clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/saidmsajady/308A_SBA.git
- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- Open the project folder and run the application.

Future Improvements:
- Integrate a database to store user interactions and preferences.
- Enhance the user interface with additional styling and animations.
- Expand the functionality to include more detailed information about each superhero.

Languages and Tools
- JavaScript: Primary language for its versatility and wide use in web development.
- Node.js: Facilitates running JavaScript code outside the browser, enabling testing and execution.
- HTML, CSS and Bootstrap: Used to structure and style the web application.
